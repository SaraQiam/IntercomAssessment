# IntercomAssessment

Hey Team Intercom ðŸ‘‹

I'm excited to share this assessment with you. I built this using Xcode 11.2 in Swift 5.0. I displayed the ouput in a simple UI (see below) just for fun ðŸ˜ƒ

Instructions:
- You will need Xcode to compile the project and run the tests
- To run the project, go to Product -> Run (âŒ˜R)
- To run the tests, go to Product -> Test (âŒ˜U)

That's it!

Looking forward to hearing back,

Sara
